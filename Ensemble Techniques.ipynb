    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble techniques combine predictions from multiple individual models to improve overall performance.\n",
    "- By aggregating predictions, ensemble methods aim to reduce variance, increase stability, and enhance predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble techniques are used to improve model robustness and generalization by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "- They often lead to better predictive performance compared to individual models, especially in complex or noisy datasets.\n",
    "- Ensemble methods can capture diverse patterns in the data and provide more reliable predictions by leveraging the wisdom of crowds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bagging is an ensemble technique that involves training multiple models independently on bootstrapped samples of the training data.\n",
    "- Each model learns to make predictions on different subsets of the data, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification) over all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting is an ensemble technique that trains a sequence of models sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous ones.\n",
    "- It assigns higher weights to misclassified instances and adjusts the model to prioritize the correct classification of those instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are the benefits of using ensemble techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved predictive performance and generalization.\n",
    "- Reduced overfitting and increased model robustness.\n",
    "- Ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data.\n",
    "- Robustness to noise and outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Are ensemble techniques always better than individual models?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models.\n",
    "- Their effectiveness depends on factors such as the quality and diversity of base models, the nature of the dataset, and the problem domain.\n",
    "- In some cases, individual models may outperform ensemble methods, especially if the dataset is small or the models are already highly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How is the confidence interval calculated using bootstrap?.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bootstrap is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic.\n",
    "- Confidence intervals are calculated by repeatedly resampling the data with replacement, computing the statistic of interest for each resampled dataset, and then determining the range of values that contain a specified proportion of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How does bootstrap work and What are the steps involved in bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bootstrap involves the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Randomly sample observations from the original dataset with replacement to create a resampled dataset.\n",
    "    2. Compute the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median) for the resampled dataset.\n",
    "    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 or more).\n",
    "    4. Calculate the confidence interval based on the distribution of the statistic obtained from the resampled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. A researcher wants to estimate the mean height of a population of trees. They measure the height of a\n",
    "sample of 50 trees and obtain a mean height of 15 meters and a standard deviation of 2 meters. Use\n",
    "bootstrap to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a sample mean height of 15 meters and a standard deviation of 2 meters from a sample of 50 trees.\n",
    "- Perform bootstrap resampling by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original sample.\n",
    "- Calculate the mean height for each resampled dataset.\n",
    "- Compute the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the resampled means to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.\n",
    "- The resulting interval provides an estimate of the population mean height with 95% confidence."
